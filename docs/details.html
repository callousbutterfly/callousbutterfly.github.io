        <h1>Dispute Resolution</h1>
        <p>In the event of any dispute arising out of or related to this agreement, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiation. Either party may initiate the negotiation process by providing notice (verbal or written) to the other party, describing the nature of the dispute and requesting a meeting to discuss possible resolutions. The parties shall meet promptly and work together in good faith to attempt to resolve the dispute.


            If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within 30 days of the initial notice, either party may initiate mediation proceedings by providing written notice to the other party. The parties shall then select a mutually acceptable mediator and participate in mediation in good faith, with the goal of reaching a mutually acceptable resolution.
            
            
            If the dispute is not resolved through negotiation or mediation, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings by providing written notice to the other party. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, and shall take place in Hood County, Texas. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on both parties, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
